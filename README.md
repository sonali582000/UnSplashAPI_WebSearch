# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Welcome to Image Search App: Explore and Discover Images Effortlessly!

### Description

In this application, users can perform image searches similar to Google Images. Upon visiting the site, users are greeted with a search bar at the top of the screen. They can enter search terms, such as "cars," and press enter. When the user submits the search, the application sends an API request to a third-party server. This server responds with a list of images related to the search term. The application then displays these images in a visually appealing grid format. Users can refine their search by entering new terms, such as "forest," and pressing enter again. The application dynamically updates to show images relevant to the new search term.
